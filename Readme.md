Prebuilt solution play_icfp2015.exe is located in bin directory - you can run it directly.

## How to build

0. Suppose we are running inside Windows OS

1. Make sure .NET 4.6 and MS Build Tools are installed (see below)

	* You can get Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6 here: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528222

	* You can get Microsoft Build Tools 2015 here: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615458

	* Or instead of installing different packages you can just install Visual Studio Community Edition

2. Run build.cmd

3. Executable play_icfp2015.exe will be built into bin directory
